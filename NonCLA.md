# Dapper - the "Non CLA" CLA

IANAL. YANAL (I hope). Let's keep this simple; if you want to contribute to Dapper, great! Let's just check a few things for the record.

By accepting this agreement, you're saying:

## You're allowed to contribute this code

The code needs to be yours (without being owned by some employer, etc), or contributed with the owner's knowledge and permission, or
in accordance with a licence that clearly allows the code to be reused in line with this project's licence (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),
and in that last case: a cross-reference back to the origin would be nice.

(for the pedants: "licence" and "license" to be used interchangeably here; language is fun)

## It isn't "your code" any more

Contributed code belongs to the Dapper project, not you the contributor. That means
Dapper can use it, not use it, remove it, or
edit it in any way - *even changing the spacing and variable names*. I know: shocking.

## No backsies

Contributing code to Dapper is permanent; you can't later demand that we remove your code because... well, anything. Even if one
of the maintainers wears socks that look *really ugly*.

## For gratis

Contributing code to Dapper gets you the bugfix or feature or whatever that you want; you have our thanks and appreciation, but unless we've
agreed something separately: that's it. No turning up unannounced at the tri-annual BBQ, or demanding... again, anything.

That's it. Basically "don't make our life harder".

Thanks!
