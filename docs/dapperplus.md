# Dapper and Dapper Plus

Dapper is the micro-ORM developed initially by Stack Overflow and now maintained independently, that offers simple, high performance
access to the ADO.NET API.

Dapper Plus is a separate tool by ZZZ Projects, which builds on the path set by Dapper, offering features like bulk operations,
and a range of [documentation for Dapper](https://www.learndapper.com/).

From 2024, Dapper Plus is now a major sponsor of Dapper, helping to secure ongoing quality development and support of the Dapper platform.
This sponsorship does not impact the ownership, license, or any other particulars of how Dapper operates. The core Dapper libraries continue
to be freely available and fully open source.
